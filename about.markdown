<h1> Hello! </h1>
<h2> My name is Sergiu Moga and I am a Computer Science and Engineering student. I like spending my free time solving CTF's and reading about Cybersecurity topics, my favourite subjects being Reverse Engineering and Exploit Development. I also enjoy contributing to Open Source Projects or building my own. </h2>
